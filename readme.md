# InternSWQParser.md

## Description

The outcome of this exercise is a single file output, containing various email headers from the supplied data.

## Part 1: Prework
Using Go, Python, or PHP, we'd like for you to prepare a code sample that will parse an archive of email files and create a single output file that contains the following:

* Date sent
* From address
* Subject line

During the on-site interview, we will change the project requirements and work through the changes required to your parser.
